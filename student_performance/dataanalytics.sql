/* To calculate the slope (b) and intercept (a) for the linear regression line 
ùë¶=ùëé+ùëèùë•
y=a+bx in SQL, you can follow these steps:
Calculate the necessary aggregates:
----------------------------------------
1. Sum of the ages (‚àëAge)
2. Sum of the GPAs (‚àëGPA)
3. Sum of the products of ages and GPAs (‚àëAge√óGPA) 
4. Sum of the squares of ages (‚àëAge 2)
5. Count of records (n)

Use these aggregates to compute the slope and intercept:
------------------------------------------------------------

‚Äãslope = sum pf prod of ages and gpa - sumOfAges*sumOfGpa/
		sumOfAgesquares - sumOfSquaresOfAges

intercept = sumOfGpa-SumOfAge/ n
